# anilist-db-songs

User script to add anime songs information and files on anilist.co

Thanks to [AniSongDB](https://github.com/xSardine/AMQ-Artists-DB) for providing the database that I use for this project !
There's a lot of caching under the hood but the loading is slow for now, I will speed it up later.

This project is WIP for now so I advise not using it for now because I will change caching method and other without notice.
