# anilist-anime-songs

User script to add anime songs information and files on [Anilist](https://anilist.co).

Thanks to [AniSongDB](https://github.com/xSardine/AMQ-Artists-DB) for providing the database that I use for this project !  
There's a lot of caching under the hood but the loading is slow for now, I will speed it up later.

You can download the latest version here: [Github Latest Release](https://github.com/PZeide/anilist-anime-songs/releases/latest/download/anilist-anime-songs.user.js)  
This userscript was tested with [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
but should be working with most of the full-featured userscripts.
